# Arfaj's Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java learning journey! I'm **Arfaj**, and this repository contains all the topics I have learned so far through tutorials and practice. Although I haven't worked with frameworks or libraries yet, I have focused on mastering Java fundamentals, including **Data Structures**, **Loops**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. 🌱

## 🌟 Motivation

Learning Java has been an exciting journey of growth! By mastering the basics, I’ve built a solid foundation in programming. The focus has been on developing a deep understanding of key concepts, which I can use as stepping stones towards more advanced topics. 🚀

## 📚 Topics Covered

Here are the key topics I have practiced:

- ☕ **Basic Java Concepts**  
  *Variables, Data Types, Operators, Type Conversion, Input/Output*

- 🔄 **Loops**  
  *For Loop, While Loop, Do-While Loop, Nested Loops, Break & Continue Statements*

- 📂 **Data Structures**  
  *Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Trees*

- 🧩 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  *Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction*

- 💡 **Methods & Functions**  
  *Defining Methods, Method Overloading, Method Overriding, Recursion*

- 📖 **File Handling**  
  *Reading & Writing Files, Working with File Streams, Serialization*

- ⚡ **Advanced Concepts**  
  *Exception Handling, Multithreading, Lambda Expressions, Streams API*

## 💡 Next Steps

I plan to continue building on these core topics, and eventually, I will explore Java frameworks like Spring or Hibernate to enhance my skills further. Stay tuned for updates as I implement what I’ve learned in more complex projects!
